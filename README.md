# parse-n-plot
Parse an excel sheet (or a few) and then plot a graph form the data.

A friend benefitted from this so I'm primarily developing it for them, but figured I'd have it available for anyone that also wanted it.

Right now it can only parse an excel sheet. Use the Dummy List in the repo to give it a try!
